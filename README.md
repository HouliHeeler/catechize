A Trivia App where you can stymie your opponents with tough challenges!

Description

    This app was built out of a love for trivia I developed during the pandemic. Our group of friends would take turns hosting and creating a trivia session for the night. This certainly won't replace that, but I felt it was a nice thing to share with the group to get some fun practice in.

Language Choices

    React felt like the right choice for this project since it was front end only, and needed a lot of responsiveness with quite a bit of data held in state. It worked very well for my needs, with the added benefit of react-dropdown-select and react-countdown-circle-timer shaving some time off of the project and letting me focus on other problems that arose.

Future of this Project

    I think this app is a finished project. There is consideration to add functionality for more players, or even to include multi-device functionality, but so far the two player setup has met everyones needs. 

    There is a chance I revisit the API the questions are drawn from in the future, but I am satisfied with it for the time being.

Reflections

    This was the first project that I have built where I really, really liked the way it ended up looking. It felt nice to handle, and I think I did a great job putting together the design.

    A big blindspot in my knowledge that reared its ugly head during the production was adapting the responsiveness of the app over devices that I had no access to. There were definitely new things to learn in that regard, and it will be an ongoing process.
